                        relatives who play a lot of video games with these consoles. His game preferences are leaning 
                        toward grindy RPG games such as <span class="bold">Rancher, Final Fantasy franchise, Gods Eater, Monster Hunter</span>, etc.

                        <p>One of his friend introduced to him Defense of the Ancient which is a Multiplayer Online Battle 
                            Arena game that can be played in PC. At first his performance was poor so he ends up losing a lot of times.
                            This brought spark to his hidden competitive side making him play the game seriously and spend most of his 
                            free time playing it. </p>

                            than his friend. He develops a passion to the game reaching high ranks and join some local tournaments. He 
                            even played different games with the same genre such as <span class="bold">League of Legends and Heroes of Newerth</span>.

                        <p>Entering his college years, he and pc game buddies went their separate ways.   No more friends to play with, 
                            he shifted to mobile games such as Mobile Legends because it was the trending game under the MOBA genre. He 
                            played a couple of similar mobile games like <span class="bold">Heroes Evolved, League of Legends: Wild Rift
                            </span> and <span class="bold">Call of Duty Mobile</span>. He became successful and ended up becoming a professional player in one of them.

                        <p>Despite winning some of the tournaments, the competition in the game went downhill. In addition to that, 
                            pandemic took place to further hinder him in his professional career in gaming. This led him to lose his 
                            passion and drive for a career in gaming.
